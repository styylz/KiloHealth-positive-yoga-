Great challenges for different problem zones. Definitely recommend to anyone that wants to lose weight and feel better without long hour at the gym or exhausting workouts.',

    description: 'I will be very straightforward - I hate sports and working out. Positive Yoga put my physical activity to the next level. I started to enjoy my morning yoga routines where I get my dose of cardio, resistance, and stretching in one place. I could barely hold a plank at the beginning. Now I’m doing various yoga poses that looked impossible at first. My body shape improved a lot and I am very motivated by both: results and the feeling of progress.',

    description: `I have many friends who practice yoga and I decided to try it myself. It is the best decision I have made in a long time. With Positive Yoga program I started to lose weight, which was demotivating me for a long time. Also, I’ve learned about yoga philosophy and poses that encourage me to practice mindfulness and pay attention to stress reduction. I am very proud of myself. Feeling better is my biggest motivation.
